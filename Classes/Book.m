// Accessors implemented below. All the "get" accessors simply return the value directly, with no additional
// logic or steps for synchronization. The "set" accessors attempt to verify that the new value is definitely
// different from the old value, to minimize the amount of work done. Any "set" which actually results in changing
// data will mark the object as "dirty" - i.e., possessing data that has not been written to the database.
// All the "set" accessors copy data, rather than retain it. This is common for value objects - strings, numbers, 
// dates, data buffers, etc. This ensures that subsequent changes to either the original or the copy don't violate 
// the encapsulation of the owning object.
